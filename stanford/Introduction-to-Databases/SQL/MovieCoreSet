1. Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg.

SELECT title FROM Movie WHERE director = 'Steven Spielberg'
----------------------------------------
2. Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

SELECT DISTINCT year
FROM Movie
NATURAL JOIN Rating
WHERE stars = 4 OR stars = 5
ORDER BY year
----------------------------------------
3. Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings.

SELECT title
FROM Movie
WHERE mID NOT IN (SELECT mID FROM Rating)
----------------------------------------
4. Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date.

SELECT name
FROM Reviewer
JOIN Rating ON Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL
----------------------------------------
5. Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars.

SELECT name, title, stars, ratingDate
FROM Movie AS M
JOIN Rating AS Rat ON M.mID = Rat.mID
JOIN Reviewer AS Rev ON Rat.rID = Rev.rID
ORDER BY name, title, stars
----------------------------------------
6. For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.

SELECT name, title
FROM Rating AS Rat1
  JOIN Rating AS Rat2 USING (rID)
  JOIN Reviewer AS Rev USING (rID)
  JOIN Movie AS M USING (mID)
WHERE Rat2.ratingDate > rat1.ratingDate AND Rat2.stars > Rat1.stars AND Rat1.mID = Rat2.mID
----------------------------------------
7. For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title. 

SELECT title, MAX(stars)
FROM Movie AS M
JOIN Rating AS Rat ON M.mID = Rat.mID
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY title
----------------------------------------
8. List movie titles and average ratings, from highest-rated to lowest-rated. If two or more movies have the same average rating, list them in alphabetical order.

SELECT title, AVG(stars) AS stars
FROM Movie AS M
JOIN Rating AS Rat ON M.mID = Rat.mID
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY stars DESC, title
----------------------------------------
9. Find the names of all reviewers who have contributed three or more ratings. (As an extra challenge, try writing the query without HAVING or without COUNT.)

SELECT name
FROM Reviewer AS Rev
JOIN Rating AS Rat ON Rev.rID = Rat.rID
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(Rev.rID) > 2
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
