1. Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind.

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Reviewer AS Rev
JOIN Rating AS Rat ON Rev.rID = Rat.rID
JOIN Movie AS M ON Rat.mID = M.mID
WHERE title = 'Gone with the Wind'
----------------------------------------
2. For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

SELECT name, title, stars
FROM Reviewer AS Rev
JOIN Rating AS Rat ON Rev.rID = Rat.rID
JOIN Movie AS M ON Rat.mID = M.mID
WHERE Rev.name = M.director
----------------------------------------
3. Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".)

SELECT name
FROM Reviewer AS Rev
UNION
SELECT title
FROM Movie AS M
ORDER BY name, title
----------------------------------------
4. Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson.

SELECT title
FROM Movie
WHERE mID NOT IN (
  SELECT mID
  FROM Rating
    JOIN Reviewer USING (rID)
  WHERE name = 'Chris Jackson'
)
----------------------------------------
5. For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order.

SELECT DISTINCT Rev1.name, Rev2.name
FROM Rating AS Rat1
  JOIN Rating AS Rat2 USING (mId)
  JOIN  Reviewer AS Rev1 ON Rat1.rID = Rev1.rID
  JOIN  Reviewer AS Rev2 ON Rat2.rID = Rev2.rID
WHERE Rat1.rID != Rat2.rID AND Rev1.name < Rev2.name
ORDER BY Rev1.name
----------------------------------------
6. For each rating that is the lowest (fewest stars) currently in the database, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars.

SELECT name, title, stars
FROM Rating
  JOIN Reviewer USING (rID)
  JOIN Movie USING (mID)
WHERE stars IN (SELECT MIN(stars) FROM Rating)
----------------------------------------
